In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` methods.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

int main() {
    MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
    obj.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    [obj release]; // Potential memory leak here!
    return 0;
}
```

The problem lies in the fact that `myString` is retained by `obj`, but if `obj` is released before `myString` is, `myString` will never be released, causing a memory leak.  This is because even after `[obj release]` the reference count of `myString` is still > 0, this would require `[obj.myString release]` before `[obj release]` to work correctly. This is more easily avoided with ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).
